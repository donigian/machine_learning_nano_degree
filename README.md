## Machine Learning Nano Degree thru Udacity

This repo contains the work I've done to complete the Machine Learning Nanodegree from Udacity designed by [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com).

It contains the following projects:

+ Titanic (Kaggle competition)
	
	> Explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. 

+ Boston Market
	> Evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.
	
+ Customer Segments

	> Analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
 
+ Student Intervention
	> Goal for this project is to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate. 
	
+ Outbrain Click Prediction (Kaggle competition)
	>  Outbrain pairs relevant content with curious readers in about 250 billion personalized recommendations
every month across many thousands of sites. In this competition, Kagglers are challenged to predict which pieces of
content its global base of users are likely to click on. Improving Outbrain’s recommendation algorithm will mean more
users uncover stories that satisfy their individual tastes.
The task is to rank the recommendations in each group by decreasing predicted likelihood of being clicked.

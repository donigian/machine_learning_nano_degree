In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

In other words, we look at a model's ability to generalize, perform well on data it hasn't used during training as a measure of it's predictive power. Both the Logistic Regression and the Gradient Boosting model's performed very similarily on the test set. Based on the data available, I recommend we use the Logistic Regression model since it's easier to interpret and understand the coefficients of features used during training.

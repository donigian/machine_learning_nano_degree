    "## I. Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is in response to a Kaggle competition to build a predictive model to determine the sale price of a property within the Ames, Iowa region. See [**House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) for further details. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being a home, real estate has been a very popular investment. While most of us realize the number of bedrooms or bathrooms would influence the price of a home, it turns out that other features such as the size of the garage or proximity to a particular landmark may influence the price just as much. \n",
    "\n",
    "The gain from an investment (such as a house in our case) is significantly impacted by the purchase price, which is why the answer for this competition matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition began on August 30, 2016 while the final submission must be made by March 1st, 2017. \n",
    "\n",
    "The source code for this project is available via a Jupyter notebook located [here](./Capstone-Project-Ames-Housing-Data.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in **Ames, Iowa**, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an end-to-end workflow for building a regressor using scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem Definition (Ames house price data). \n",
    "\t+ Experimental Design: identify data sources, formats, data dictionary, features and target. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loading the Dataset\n",
    "\t+ Load and pre-process the data into a representation which is ready for model training\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis \n",
    "\t+ Gather insights by using exploratory methods (univariate feature distributions, skew and correlated attributes to name a few)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feature Engineering  \n",
    "\n",
    "  + calculate age of property (relative to oldest)\n",
    "  + years till remodel\n",
    "  + linear combinations of square footage attributes (DID NOT HELP!)\n",
    "  + one hot encoding of categorical features\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. Feature Selection\n",
    "  + dropping highly correlated features (see correlation section above)\n",
    "  + PCA\n",
    "  + Recusive Feature Elimination (DID NOT HELP!)\n",
    "  + LASSO\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evaluate Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Evaluate Algorithms with Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Algorithm Tuning\n",
    "\t+ Use GridSearch to search & tune hyper-parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Ensemble Methods (such as Bagging and Boosting, Gradient Boosting looked good).  \n",
    "\n",
    "10. Finalize Model (use all training data and confirm using validation dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "Given this is a Kaggle competition, the evaluation metric has been specified as the [**Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction/details/evaluation). \n",
    "\n",
    "![Eval Equation](../assets/ames/Evaluation_Ames__Kaggle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The root mean squared error metric intutively is suitable for house price prediction since:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ a regressor outputs numerical predictions which won't exactly match the target values in the data set (due to irreducible error)\n",
    "+ can use the outputs of the regressor to measure difference between values in training dataset vs predicted values by my model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Correlation refers to the relationship between two variables and how they may or may not change together. The most common method for calculating correlation is Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (assumes normal distribution). A correlation of -1 or 1 shows a full negative or positive correlation respectively, while a value of 0 shows no correlation at all. Some machine learning algorithms like linear and logistic regression can suffer poor performance if there are highly correlated attributes in your dataset. Let's review all of the pairwise correlations of the attributes in your dataset. \n",

    "This supervized learning project requires I build a regressor. Since I have no idea which algorithms will work well, I will build a test harness aka (see Spot Check below) to evaluate several algorithms based on the Root Meas Squared Error (RMSE) metric. I have implemented a function called `rmse_cv` to perform this evaluation locally using cross validation. This is the metric I will be using and comparing against the Kaggle Public Leaderboard (LB).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more details about the test harness in the implementation section. The overall idea is to iterate over a list of regression algorithms listed below and analyze how each performs. I will then take the top 3 performing ones and tune further.\n",

    "+ LASSO \n",
    "  + During EDA, noticed several features were linearly correlated to target. Fitting a straight line through this data may provide to be a winning strategy.\n",
    "  + LASSO is a regression method that involves penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients. By penalizing (or equivalently constraining the sum of the absolute values of the estimates) you end up in a situation where some of the parameter estimates may be exactly zero. Automatic feature/variable selection\n",
    "+ CART \n",
    "  + Each root node represents a single input variable (x) and a split point on that variable (assuming the variable is numeric). The leaf nodes of the tree contain an output variable (y) which is used to make a prediction\n",
    "  + A decision tree may be useful in the event where a value for a feature can help split the data by maximizing the information gain. \n",
    "+ KNeighborsRegressor\n",
    "  + K nearest neighbors is an algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (distance functions).\n",
    "  + Since home prices vary by geography, this is why the real estate profession uses comparables to determine sale prices. \n",
    "+ XGBRegressor since 70% of Kaggle competitions are won by XGBoost. \n",
    "  + Decision trees (like CART)\n",
    "  + Similarily for AdaBoostRegressor & GradientBoostingRegressor, boosting algorithms use future weak learners to correct what past weak learners got wrong.  \n",
    "  + Some features are more important to sale price than others. Boosted tree algorithms will help identify a set of feature value splits which will help predict sale price more accurately.\n",
    "+ RandomForestRegressor\n",
    "  + An esemble of weak learners each of which contains a subset of features with bagging might pick up on the structure of the problem to be learned.\n",
    "  + Like evolution, some trees (mutations) will prove to be useful while others will fail. RF will help us run different feature subsets in parallel to observe their predictive power to sale price. \n",
    "+ ExtraTreesRegressor\n",
    "  + Fits a number of randomized decision trees (a.k.a. extra-trees) on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.\n",
    "  + In the event that only a few features have predictive power, ET will help identify which combination of feature subsets help predict sale price.\n",
    "+ Support Vector Regressor\n",
    "  + An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n",
    "  + Since PCA showed that most of the variance could be explained by the first 3 components. Suppor vectors may prove similar value.\n",
    "+ Deep Learning using Keras & TensforFlow\n",
    "  + Say you have two sets of neurons: ones that receive an input signal and ones that send an output signal. When the input layer receives an input it passes on a modified version of the input to the next layer. In a deep network, there are many layers between the input and output, allowing the algorithm to use multiple processing layers, composed of multiple linear and non-linear transformations.\n",

    "### Benchmark\n",
    "Kaggle maintains a portion of the data for each competition (including this one) as a hold out set which is used to evaluate the generalizability of our model to new unseen data (aka private leaderboard).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle competitions are decided by a model's performance on a test data set. Kaggle maintains the answers for the test dataset, but withholds them to compare with the submitted predictions. The Public Score is what you receive after each submission (calculated using a statistical evaluation metric described on the Evaluation page). The Public Score is being determined from only a fraction of the test data set (25-33%). This is the Public Leaderboard, and it shows some the performance of your submission relative to others during the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the competition ends, Kaggle takes the selected submissions and score the predictions against the REMAINING FRACTION of the test set. You never receive ongoing feedback about your score on this portion; hence the name (Private leaderboard). Final competition results are based on the Private leaderboard, and the Winner is the person(s) at the top of the Private Leaderboard. This separation of the test set into public and private portions is what ensures that the most accurate but generalized model is the one that wins the challenge. If you based your model solely on the public data which gives you constant feedback, you run the danger of a model that overfits to the specific noise in that data. This addresses one of the hard challenges in data science is to avoid overfitting, by leaving your model flexible to out-of-sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal for this project was to place among top 20% (RMSE score of 0.12095) of the Kaggle public leaderboard.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform well, it's critical to define a benchmark and cross validation strategy locally. I created a method to calculate the Root Mean Squared Error and used it locally as I experimented with various algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since scikit learn has a convention convention to maximize scoring functions, while RSME is minimized. By multiplying by negative one, higher values of negative mean squared error are better than lower values and thus conform to the scikit learn convention.\n",

    "## III. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering\n",
    "For most real world data science projects, data preprocessing often ends up taking a large portion of the effort and time. Fortuantely, this is less of an issue for Kaggle competitions since the data is already represented in a tabular format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since some learning algorithms are negatively impacted by differing scales of the raw data, I performed a log transformation on the numeric features as well as the target. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, due to the large number of missing values (see EDA above), I used the scikit-learn imputer module to impute the mean for missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both our training & test data sets contain both numerical (quantitative) and categorical (qualitative) features. Since scikit-learn expects a tabular numerical training data set, I must convert all categoricals using one-hot encoding (aka binary features).\n",

    "+ Recusive Feature Elimination (DID NOT HELP!)\n",
    "+ LASSO\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complications\n",
    "I encountered several complications as the competition got underway.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ I had a million ideas in my head of things I wanted to try, but didn't have luxury of time. As a result, I created a workflow (see above) and stayed disciplined to working through each step of the workflow.\n",
    "+ My first Kaggle submission was bottom of the public leaderboard. I quickly realized there was a formatting error and was pleased with the outcome of the resubmission.\n",
    "+ The more code I developed, the slower it became to execute the entire notebook. In the future, I plan to create multiple notebooks and share artifacts between each to save time.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Evaluate Algorithms (Spot Check) with Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "I suspect that differing scales of the raw data may be negatively impacting the skill of some of the algorithms. I have performed a standardization in which data is transformed such that each attribute has a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of 1.\n",

    "One of the crucial aspects for my model to work is to perform the same transformations on training vs production (hold out) test set. I've tested the model against the test set provided by Kaggle. I've made sure this is done in a consistent manner which prevents leakage from occuring as well as well as being robust to small perturbations (log feature transformations). The generalizability of the model will be evident at the end of competition. The results can be trusted since it takes care of the precautions mentioned above.\n",

    "### Justification\n",
    "As you can see from the refinement result table, the final results found are stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier. The final model is a linear combination (80%) LASSO and (20%) XGBoost. Due to the high ranking on the public leaderboard, I conclude the model has sufficient predictive power to predict Sale Price.\n",

    "You can observe that the RSME for training is much lower than test which expected since we trained using the training data set and our test set doesn't contain targets. You can also see that the model doesn't perform any better (flat line) after 50 estimators on the test set.\n",

    "1. Problem Definition (Ames house price data). \n",
    "\t+ Experimental Design: identify data sources, formats, data dictionary, features and target. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loading the Dataset\n",
    "\t+ Load and pre-process the data into a representation which is ready for model training\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis \n",
    "\t+ Gather insights by using exploratory methods (univariate feature distributions, skew and correlated attributes to name a few)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feature Engineering  \n",
    "  + calculate age of property (relative to oldest)\n",
    "  + years till remodel\n",
    "  + linear combinations of square footage attributes (DID NOT HELP!)\n",
    "  + one hot encoding of categorical features\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. Feature Selection\n",
    "  + dropping highly correlated features (see correlation section above)\n",
    "  + PCA\n",
    "  + Recusive Feature Elimination (DID NOT HELP!)\n",
    "  + LASSO\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evaluate Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Evaluate Algorithms with Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Algorithm Tuning\n",
    "\t+ Use GridSearch to search & tune hyper-parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Ensemble Methods (such as Bagging and Boosting, Gradient Boosting looked good).  \n",
    "\n",
    "10. Finalize Model (use all training data and confirm using validation dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interestings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Having gone through the iterative process of model selection & evaluation with the public leaderboard, I'm confident I'll be able to do this in the future for more comprehensive projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was also quite pleased with the support Kaggle users provide via the forums. Taking the time to go through the questions and kernels is a great learning resource for practitioners. I learned some new techniques which I'm looking forward to using in the future such as identifying how the private and public data sets were split as this information will help me build a more generalizable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges**\n",
    "One of the challenges with working with Kaggle is to make sure you're not overfitting to the public leaderboard. It's tempting to see your score rise and sometimes there are quick shortcuts which may raise your score but may not necessarily make sense. It's important to keep a disciplined approach during model selection and evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also critical to structure your code in a way which produces repeatable & reproducible results. Writing modular code which is easy to communicate with others,  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "I plan to work on this Kaggle competition well after my capstone project submission. I believe that engineering new features from existing ones will be the key to building a generalizable model. For example, experimenting with newly created features which are linear combinations of existing ones (BsmtUnfSF/TotalBsmtSF) may provide some lift in the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the activities I found tremendously useful is reading through the forums. Not only do you find code refactoring opportunitties, but you also gain insight into how others decide to approach this learning problem. Data science often involves experimentation and contributing my EDA as well as baseline model is an improvement both personally and to the community at large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another improvement I could do is define a more aggresive strategy for dealing with outliers. The most obvious is to remove them.\n",
